There may be a lack of low-income sexual health clinics in certain areas of Toronto. It is important to have more sexual health clinics in order to reduce the chance for unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases. Additionally, for low-income communities, they are more adversely impacted by a lack of sexual health clinics in their area. Nearby health clinics are essential for anyone wanting to get access to care. \n\n<br/> City inhabitants may benefit from an increase in the amount of avaialble health clinics. The major question will ask: in Toronto, where should someone open their low-income sexual health clinic?"
